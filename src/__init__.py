This Python script is a direct transcription and adaptation of Mark Ramsey's original MATLAB 
implementation as described in the publication:

    "Template Matching for Improved Accuracy in Molecular Tagging Velocimetry"
    Marc C. Ramsey and Robert W. Pitz

All algorithmic methods, logic, and workflows closely follow the techniques outlined in 
the original work, with adjustments made only for syntax, language-specific practices, and 
minor optimization for Python execution.

Tagging Velocimetry. [Publication details].

This script is intended for academic, research, and educational purposes.
